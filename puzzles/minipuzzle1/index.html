            <h3>The book cipher used here is a variant called the <b>paragraph-word</b> book cipher.</h3>
            <h3>It is formatted as <b>paragraph:word</b>, and the letter corresponds to the first letter of that word.</h3>

            <h3>What text does it use for the ciphertext, though? The original notepad journal, of course!</h3>
            <h3>You can also deduce the cipher through the given examples like <b>2:2</b>, which corresponds to the first letter of the second word in the second paragraph, which is <b>A</b>.</h3>
