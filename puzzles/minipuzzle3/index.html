            <h3>This looks quite hard, and there's not much obvious clues in the picture that can help us.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Aside from the puzzle itself, another clue of the puzzle comes from the title '<b>Decanting Problems</b>'.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>A general description of 'Decanting Problems' generally goes like this:</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Decanting problems are also called <b>water jug puzzles</b>, are classic logic challenges where you measure an exact amount of liquid using fixed-capacity jugs by pouring between them until a jug is full or empty.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3 style="color: rgb(200, 200, 200)"><i>(You can either fill a cup full, empty the cup or pour it to other cups. No eyeballing! You need to make the first and second cup contain 4 unit of water each. Can you solve it?)</i></h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Interesting! So this puzzle somehow relates to this 'water jug puzzle'. Not exactly sure how that helps.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>In the puzzle, we see cups with letters and pipes-like thing connecting them.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>The puzzle looks like it's split in half by the horizontal line, so maybe there's two parts?</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>

            <h3 style="color: rgb(200, 200, 200)"><i>(This is the same image, it's just here so you don't have to scroll up)</i></h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>The first (left) part is... quite obvious. Looking from down to top, you get the word '<b>Hello</b>'.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Okay, but what exactly is this puzzle supposed to be? And what does the grey lines mean?</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Maybe it's water puzzles with pipes? Well given the minimal amount of context, I would assume that this is quite a popular puzzle.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>And indeed, on a second thought, this does remind me of another water-related puzzle called '<b>water filling puzzles</b>'.</h3>

            <h3>'Geniuses only' is quite exaggerated, I guess I'm a genius! Anyways, if you look at this 'water filling puzzle', it looks extremely similar to our puzzle!</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Maybe this is the method to solve our puzzle?</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Most of the context of these 'water filling puzzles' want to find which 'tank' will be filled first.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>But since we need to find a <b>phrase</b>, maybe if we do it repeatedly, we should get a phrase.</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>Let's solve the second (right) part of the puzzle with this method!</h3>

            <h3>After all of this, you should get the answer like: "<b>HELLO, WOTER PUZZLES</b>".</h3>
            <div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
            <h3>But honestly, as long as you get the phrase '<b>WOTER PUZZLES</b>', it counts as correct.</h3>
